## We have a few toy drones in the house - the kids love them and I love them. They're relatively easy to fly and a lot of fun.

But, we wanted more, and a low cost "more" at that, so we decided to build our own "proper" racing drone, from scratch with no knowledge, basing it on a 3D printed chassis we found on the Internet.

This post covers our build process, the components chosen and their costs, and the pitfalls we encountered along the way. 

We were coming at this from a perspective of "zero knowledge" - short of flying our toy drones, we had no idea what we were doing. Whilst, there are lots of good resources on Drones on the Internet, on which we relied heavilly, maybe the fact this blog covers our entire learning curve in one piece, will make it useful for others new to the hobby. I hope so. And I hope it will encourage others - if we can do it, anyone can!


## Build Stages

The build comprised four stages:

1. [Sourcing, printing and assembling the Chassis](#chassis)
2. [Sourcing and assembling the components](#components)
3. Programming the Flight Controller and ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers)
4. Programming the Transmitter & binding with the Receiver
5. Tweaks and enhancements

## Build Constraints

You can spend a lot of money in this hobby - just google - but our drone should be cheap to make and maintainable. 

Since, we'd likely crash and break something we'd need to be able to cost effectively repair it. This made 3D printing the chassis an attractive option.

Similarly, with regard to the components: a pile of cheap mangled electronics is easier to swallow than a pile of expensive mangled electronics. So we'd be trying to get the cheapest of everything (which has some drawbacks which we'll come to, but you can probably guess!)

Many drone builds have cameras on them and are flown "FPV" (First Person View). This would add significantly to the cost (video transmitter/receiver and screen or goggles) and has some additional legal constraints (in the UK at least) so was out-of-scope for our build. We can add this later should we wish, but for now we will fly "line of sight" just as we do with the toy drones.

That's all. Not really too many contraints!

## 1. Sourcing, printing and assembling the Chassis

You can buy chassis kits made from Carbon Fibre. They look great and are reknowned for their strength. Prices vary but typically the kits are priced between £50 and £100. As already stated,  for reasons of cost and maintenance, we decided to print our chassis.

My first port of call for any off-the-shelf 3D printable model is Thingiverse, and true to form, there were quite a few printable drones frames on there. 

We opted for the [Peon 230 - Quadcopter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:629338) since it was a modular design. Break an arm and you'd need to print another arm, not the entire bottom piece of the chassis.

Videos of the build process and indeed evidence of the thing flying also encouraged us. I would recommend this model.

The trick when printing is to ramp up the infill on the parts most exposed to stress to give them extra strength. We printed the arms at 60% infill and the rest at 30% infill. This makes print times considerably longer but results in parts that will hopefully withstand a few knocks. 

We used a combination of red and blue PLA filament (ABS would be the better choice, but we had none), to provide a visual indication of the orientation of the craft - blue at the front and red at the rear.

Some people also print the standoffs (the inserts that space the two layers of the chassis), but we chose to purchase 40mm blue annodised aluminium standoffs for our build. This chassis model needs 6 standoffs.

Assembly of the chassis is straightforward. We used M3 bolts and M3 Nyloc nuts we obtained from Toolstation underneath the drone. On the top we used 6 spare black hex bolts that came with the motors, for asthetic reasons only really.

I mentioned ABS would be the better material to print with. ABS will not degrade with moisture whereas PLA will. Also ABS prints at much higher temperatures than PLA. This is important since during your assembly you'll find yourself applying heat at temperatures that approach and sometimes exceed the melting point of PLA filament. Examples include soldering, hot-gluing and heat-shrinking components. 

Ideally you'd do all this away from the chassis but it's not always possible. 

Use ABS if you have it.

## 2. Sourcing and assembling the components

Most of the parts we sourced via Ebay, and in most cases the prices of items direct from Asia were too attractive to ignore. However, one downside is that lead times for delivery are quite lengthy. In some cases our build was held up by 3 weeks waiting for a particular part.

The component list isn't long however:

- [Lipo Battery + Charger/Balancer](#battery)
- [Power Distribution Board (PDB)](#pdb)
- [Flight Controller](#flightcontroller)
- Brushless Motor * 4
- Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) * 4
- Receiver
- [LED lights](#pdb)
- [Battery straps](#battery)
- 40mm Aluminum Standoffs
- Heat Shrink (various sizes)

If you don't already have one, which we didn't, you'll also need a Transmitter, to control your Drone.

### Lipo Battery + Charger/Balancer

We needed a 3S Lipo battery for our build. This is a three cell lithium polyer battery with the cells connected in series to sum the voltage. That's what the "S" represents. 

Lipo batteries, and indeed their maintenance, are beyond the scope of this post, but here are some basics as we've come to understand them.

You do not want to overcharge a Lipo battery or conversely discharge it too far - both will impact the life span of the battery, if not kill it directly!

One other important thing to note is that Lipo batteries, especially defective ones, pose a real fire risk, so should be stored and charged in special fire proof bags.

A 3S battery is rated at it's nominal voltage of 11.1v (3 * 3.7v). This is a median voltage between the fully charged and discharged states. Peak voltage is 12.6v (3 * 4.2v) and absolute minimium discharged voltage is 9.0v (3 * 3.0v). Allowing the battery voltage to fall below this level will damage it. 

Reading around, many people seem to consider a higher voltage as the minimum - as high as the nominal voltage of 11.1v, or 3.7v per cell.

Batteries are also rated by milliamp hours (mAh) and C rating. Generally higher mAh will allow you to fly for longer. C rating is usually two numbers; a constant rating and a peak rating. What you need will depend on the type of drone you build, but for race drones a high constant and peak C rating is preferrable, providing higher power in bursts, should it be needed.

We're using an Overlander 3S 1600mAh battery with a constant 35C and peak 65C.  We bought this from a local RC Hobby shop, preferring not to take any chances with the battery, and the unit was just under £15.

To charge the battery we need a charger. Ideally a charger/balancer to make sure that all the cells in the Lipo pack are charged equallly so that our voltage is provided by three cells, each at the same voltage.

We purchased the charger from the same RC Hobby shop - a Radient Reflex 2-3S unit which can also charge 2S Lipo batteries. It cost just under £15 as well.

The battery is strapped to the top of the Drone with 2 velcro battery straps.

That's all I'll post on batteries, [there's plenty of good stuff on the Internet](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=lipo+battery+maintenance&oq=lipo+battery+maintenance&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i30k1l8j0i22i10i30k1.3506.5567.0.5775.12.11.0.0.0.0.123.998.8j3.11.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.11.994...0i67k1.0.wQUVgc-6nvQ). Please make sure you understand Lipo battery maintenance and the risks inherent in them.

### Power Distribution Board (PDB)

The PDB provides power for everything else on the Drone. The Lipo battery connects to the PDB which offers various solder pads, positive and negative, for connecting everything else.

Ideally the PDB should handle voltage conversion too, as not all components you add will require 12v. For example the Flight Controller requires a 5v supply. 

A good PDB will offer 12v, plus 5v and 3.3v via onboard voltage converters. If it doesn't you'll need to provide any voltage conversion required, by adding additional components.

We chose the Matex PDB-XT60 which offers 12v and 5v and which cost £3.19 delivered.

Our LED lights, which just need power, and feature a tiny control unit to set colour and flashing speed, are soldered direct to 12v pads. The LEDs cost £2.39 delivered.

We also soldered each Electronic Speed Controller's positive and negative wires to a pair of 12v pads. Finally, we soldered a pair of wires to the 5V and Gnd to provide power to the Flight Controller.

The PDB is tight fit between the aluminium standoffs such that the standoffs have the potential to short between positive and negative pads once soldered. To eliminate this risk, heat shrink was dropped over each standoff at the rear of the drone and melted into place. The PDB was hot glued into to place on the lower piece of the chassis body.

### Flight Controller

The Flight Controller is the brains of the Drone. Using a combination of Accelerometer and Gyro it determines how control inputs are converted into outputs sent to the Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC). Other sensors may be connected to the Flight Controller, or it may even include them.

To this board we'll connect 5v power, our ESCs and our receiver. 

We chose the Naze32 Acro Revision 6 Flight Controller which was £8.55 delivered.

Flight Controllers are nothing without the firmware that runs them. Three popular options are Baseflight, Cleanflight and Betaflight.  We went with Betaflight and flashed it to the Naze32. The Chrome app for Betaflight makes it particularly straightforward to flash new firmware and subsequently configure it.

At this point it is worth saying that while very affordable, the Naze32 is a relatively old design and better flight controllers with faster processors are available. The Naze32 provides limited to no support for newer ESC control protocols such as DSHOT, and also the Betaflight software development team have stated that they can no longer guarantee support for the Naze32 board in the firmware going forward. This means at some point you will find you cannot flash the latest Betaflight firmware to the Naze32.

That said, the Naze32 is cheap, currently runs a very comprehesive version of Betaflight, and, if it works will you want to upgrade the firmware? I suspect I won't!
