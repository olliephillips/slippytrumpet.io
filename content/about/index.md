My blog on the technologies that ~~have been messing with me~~ I've been messing with.

I do a lot of messing. I pick stuff up and put it down. I don’t always finish stuff. 
But this is how I learn. In fact most of the good stuff I’ve done in my career has roots
in something I’ve simply been meddling with at some point, usually much earlier. 

I find bigger ideas take time to come together and are usually made up of many smaller ones. Stepping stones if you like.

The name "slippytrumpet"? That's a reference to motorcyling and Triumph - and a whole different story. One I hope to come back to.
