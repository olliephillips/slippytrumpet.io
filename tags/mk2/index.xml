So&amp;hellip; I have a Prusa Original Mk2 3D Printer. Learnings specific to this machine, though I expect you could generalise much of this. 1) Prusa Original Mk2 is a great product. Mine was a kit. I built it over 4 evenings, and on the few occasions I&amp;rsquo;ve contacted support, they&amp;rsquo;ve been great.
2) You can spend thousands on a 3D printer. Don&amp;rsquo;t. Prusa is reasonable cost for its ability.</description></item></channel></rss>
