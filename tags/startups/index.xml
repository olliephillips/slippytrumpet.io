The commercial entity behind RethinkDB will soon be no more. The project will hopefully continue as community driven open source, although the details are unclear - the who and how has yet to be ironed out.
From my first encounter with the database it was clear that RethinkDB had something going on. A performant document oriented database had to be a given, yes. But the glorious admin UI, effortless clustering, and intuitive ReQL query language were lovely to see and use; the extensive documentation and examples, great to fall back on.</description></item></channel></rss>
