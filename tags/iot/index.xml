I read the article with interest. Application communication, at the Ethernet frame level, a lower level than TCP sockets, was something I&amp;rsquo;d never considered before.
Of particular interest was the &amp;ldquo;broadcast&amp;rdquo; nature of the communication. In contrast to sockets - though frames can also be addressed to specific devices - frames can be broadcast network-wide, enabling more than one device to listen and use the frame payload.</description></item><item><title>Web Bluetooth to MQTT Gateway with Puck.js</title><link>https://slippytrumpet.io/2017/04/webbluetooth-to-mqtt-gateway/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2017 12:36:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://slippytrumpet.io/2017/04/webbluetooth-to-mqtt-gateway/</guid><description>If you read A little bit of Web Bluetooth you&amp;rsquo;ll know a bit about Puck.js and the new Web Bluetooth API already. But what, aside from building a gimmicky two factor authentication system, can you do with it? I had some ideas.
What about an interface through which you can program multiple Pucks at the same time? The Web IDE allows you to connect and program one Puck at a time.</description></item></channel></rss>
