I read the article with interest. Application communication, at the Ethernet frame level, a lower level than TCP sockets, was something I&amp;rsquo;d never considered before.
Of particular interest was the &amp;ldquo;broadcast&amp;rdquo; nature of the communication. In contrast to sockets - though frames can also be addressed to specific devices - frames can be broadcast network-wide, enabling more than one device to listen and use the frame payload.</description></item></channel></rss>
