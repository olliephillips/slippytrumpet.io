<p>1) Prusa Original Mk2 is a great product. Mine was a kit. I built it over 4 evenings, and on the few occasions I&rsquo;ve contacted support, they&rsquo;ve been great.</p>

<p>2) You can spend thousands on a 3D printer. Don&rsquo;t. Prusa is reasonable cost for its ability. That&rsquo;s borne out by the waiting list I guess.</p>

<p><img src="https://thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/0f/ab/be/96/00/f56a6cd1de2b9a1f84e5bf135fca885b_preview_featured.JPG" alt="alt text" title="SD Card holder" />

<p>3) Filament can kill you. Buy cheap and it&rsquo;s going to smart a bit. Your prints won&rsquo;t stick, or will fail at some point. Your interested children will disappear fast. Turns out, there&rsquo;s no glory in 3D Printer configuration management.</p>

<p>4) Prusa filament is great. It&rsquo;s not expensive at all, until you factor in the carriage costs. Shame. They packed a very high quality PLA filament (IMO) with each printer/printer kit - you just can&rsquo;t justify buying more, unless you can order in size :(</p>

<p>5) Cheap filament will dement you. It will drip from the extruder, it will form &ldquo;elephants foot&rdquo; and any successful prints will be brittle. You&rsquo;ll need more infill to get the same model strength. In fact,  I wonder if it&rsquo;s actually cheaper at all when all said and done.</p>

<p>6) Heated beds are great. I get extra adhesion. But often not enough. More than a few times I&rsquo;ve used the Pritstick - just to be sure.</p>

<p>7) Firmware. Sometimes I think, &ldquo;Why Prusa Original Mk2? Why you do that?&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s a large scratch in the Heat Bed of mine, which happened during calibration - for some reason - when the extruder head decided to submarine into it.</p>

<p>8) Often multi-part models are best printed in separate jobs. This way if one part unsticks from the bed and takes up residence on the extruder head, it doesn&rsquo;t get dragged through the other components, which until this point were printing perfectly well.</p>

<p>9) Cheap filament. Spare yourself. It&rsquo;s your ticket to a numb night toggling printer settings, hoping for better.</p>

<p>10) Ambient temperature is a factor. Cold rooms will amplify issues. I&rsquo;m on a run of good quality prints at the moment, but have to acknowledge ambient temp works in my favour as we head into UK Summer. Noted that I had a slew of fails through winter&hellip; Similar models TBF.</p>

<p>11) Mitigation. For me.. set the bed temperature at 60c, put a 215c first layer down at 0.15mm, and then revert to 205c therafter - whatever the model resolution. Shotgun approach or your new personal mantra..?</p>

<p>12) Software. Good software will accelerate your path to making things you&rsquo;ve designed yourself, rather than just printing off-the-shelf models others have made. I&rsquo;ve tried a few applications, and I&rsquo;ve settled on Fusion 360. It&rsquo;s free for personal use, has a relatively shallow learning curve, and is intuitive to use.</p>

<p>13) Print stuff. It&rsquo;s often not plain sailing, and were it we&rsquo;d learn nothing. I&rsquo;ll wager, regardless of how much you spend on the machine itself, there&rsquo;ll be some trial and error required.</p>
