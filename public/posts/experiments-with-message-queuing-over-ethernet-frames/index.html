<h2 id="in-his-article-network-protocol-breakdown-ethernet-and-go-https-medium-com-mdlayher-network-protocol-breakdown-ethernet-and-go-de985d726cc1-matt-layher-describes-the-ethernet-protocol-and-introduces-a-couple-of-libraries-written-in-go">In his article, <a href="https://medium.com/@mdlayher/network-protocol-breakdown-ethernet-and-go-de985d726cc1">Network Protocol Breakdown: Ethernet and Go</a>, Matt Layher describes the Ethernet protocol and introduces a couple of libraries written in Go.</h2>

<p>I read the article with interest. Application communication, at the Ethernet frame level, a lower level than TCP sockets, was something I&rsquo;d never considered before.</p>

<p>Of particular interest was the &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; nature of the communication. In contrast to sockets - though frames can also be addressed to specific devices - frames can be broadcast network-wide, enabling more than one device to listen and use the frame payload.</p>

<p>I could see some parallels between Ethernet frames and MQTT, a protocol I use frequently in my hardware projects.</p>

<p>I could also see a few distinct advantages over MQTT. I don&rsquo;t want to go into loads of detail here, but, suffice to say, a cheap, convenient but very insecure approach to using MQTT in what are often just &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; hardware projects, is to bounce traffic off of one of the free remote MQTT brokers. And I have been known to do this ;)</p>

<h2 id="so-why-ethernet-frames">So why Ethernet Frames?</h2>

<p>Potentially, by using Ethernet frames there would be no requirement for the MQTT broker so that&rsquo;s one less piece of hardware to configure and manage (if you host your own); messages would stay within the local area network, behind the router firewall, so we&rsquo;re secure by default and; we might achieve higher-speed transmissions, since we would not be sending data all the way off to a remote MQTT broker, only to receive it back from that broker on another machine sitting within the same local area network.</p>

<p>So I set about writing a package on top of Matt&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/mdlayher/ethernet">Ethernet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mdlayher/raw">Raw</a> packages with two objectives in mind:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Ethernet frame messaging to emulate MQTT specifically by providing pub/sub functionality, and;</li>
<li>Provide an API which would feel familiar to MQTT users and therefore be a relatively simple drop in replacement for a typical MQTT client library.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>The package itself is fairly straightforward - most of the sophisticated stuff is performed by the two packages of Matt&rsquo;s which it imports, but it satisfies both of the objectives mentioned above.</p>

<p>I took the liberty of naming the package EFMQ (for Ethernet Frames Message Queue), and you can find it <a href="http://github.com/olliephillips/efmq">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="objective-1-provide-pub-sub-functionality">Objective 1 - Provide Pub/Sub functionality</h3>

<p>Pub/Sub is emulated by devices maintaining a list of their own subscriptions and comparing each received message&rsquo;s topic to this list. If topic matches a subscription, the message is put on an unbuffered channel for subsequent processing. Any messages that do not match a subscription are simply discarded.</p>

<h3 id="objective-2-provide-an-api-similar-to-mqtt">Objective 2 - Provide an API similar to MQTT</h3>

<p>This is best illustrated by a couple of examples.</p>

<h4 id="publisher">Publisher</h4>

<p>In this contrived example, we&rsquo;re publishing temperature data on the <code>temp</code> topic every second. <code>wlan0</code> represents the network interface used by the device, in this case a Raspberry Pi Zero W.</p>

<pre><code>mq, err := efmq.NewEFMQ(&quot;wlan0&quot;) 
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
t := time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)
for range t.C {
  if err := mq.Publish(&quot;temp&quot;, &quot;20.5&quot;); err != nil {
 	log.Fatalln(err)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><br/></p>

<h4 id="subscriber">Subscriber</h4>

<p>In this example another device in the same network subscribes to the <code>temp</code> topic and then listens indefinitely. Any messages which match the subscription are made available on the <code>mq.Message</code> channel.</p>

<pre><code>mq, err := efmq.NewEFMQ(&quot;wlan0&quot;)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
mq.Subscribe(&quot;fermenter&quot;)
mq.Listen()
for msg := range mq.Message {
  fmt.Println(&quot;topic:&quot;, msg.Topic)
  fmt.Println(&quot;message:&quot;, msg.Payload)
}
</code></pre>

<p><br/></p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re off to a good start by removing the latency transmitting messages via a remote server, and the messaging is direct between two devices, no third device (a local MQTT broker) is needed to relay messages, but as yet I don&rsquo;t have any benchmarks.</p>

<p>In testing, I&rsquo;ve been running a dummy setup using two Raspberry Pi Zero W devices which have been communicating using EFMQ at an interval of 50ms for over a week with no issues. 50ms means 20 messages per second - more than sufficient for most monitoring and control applications that I&rsquo;m likely to want to build!</p>

<p>If you give EFMQ a try please let me know how it works for you!</p>
