<h2 id="maybe-you-heard-the-commercial-entity-behind-rethinkdb-will-soon-be-no-more">Maybe you heard. The commercial entity behind RethinkDB will soon be no more.</h2>

<p>The project will hopefully continue as community driven open source, although the details are unclear - the who and how has yet to be ironed out.</p>

<p>From my first encounter with the database it was clear that <a href="https://www.rethinkdb.com">RethinkDB</a> had something going on. A performant document oriented database had to be a given, yes. But the glorious admin UI, effortless clustering, and intuitive ReQL query language were lovely to see and use; the extensive documentation and examples, great to fall back on.</p>

<p>But, for all of this goodness it was, I think, the team - the people behind RethinkDB - that made the biggest impression. Their knowledge and their command of branding, marketing and community engagement, positioned RethinkDB as a database that was bound to succeed, or so I thought. Like many individuals and organizations I began to evaluate and deploy RethinkDB with my applications - and I have nothing but good to say about it.</p>

<p>So why the demise?</p>

<p>So far there haven&rsquo;t been many details released and I&rsquo;m keen to understand more as I&rsquo;m sure many are. But I suppose the money ran out and the user community and acquisition rate didn&rsquo;t merit additional investment. That&rsquo;s usually the bones of it.</p>

<p>One missed opportunity - or nail in the coffin, depending on your viewpoint -  was that at the time of the acquisition of Compose.io - a cloud database provider - by IBM in July 2015, RethinkDB was available via Compose.io. You could get started with a multiple node RethinkDB cluster just as easilly as setting up some shared hosting.</p>

<p>Post acquisition, IBM went on to integrate many of the Compose.io database services into their own up-and-coming Bluemix Cloud service, but RethinkDB was notably absent.</p>

<p>Whilst Compose.io continued to offer RethinkDB, I can&rsquo;t help but think availabilty through Bluemix itself, could have been a springboard for growth.</p>

<p>I did ask IBM Bluemix about RethinkDB and was only told &ldquo;it&rsquo;s on the way&rdquo;.  Oddly, it didn&rsquo;t show up in Bluemix until around the time RethinkDB announced they were shutting down as an organisation.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t quite know what to make of that. At best it&rsquo;s miserable timing.</p>

<p>But looking to the future.</p>

<p>Many of the engineering team I understand are now working with Stripe, and an element are also trying to kickstart RethinkDB into a community developed open source project.</p>

<p>If you want to get involved, check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c27S3Ij2WLB_JiUmpIGkbwJOgVL8T7nW0sPz7OJZjro/edit">the information here</a> and complete the form. I have.</p>

<p>So it seems we are at the end of the beginning, but hopefully not the end of RethinkDB. As a RethinkDB fan and user, to the people behind the product and the community&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you and good luck.&rdquo;</p>
