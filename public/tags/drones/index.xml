      <description>We wanted to build a racing drone on a 3D printed frame  Pictured: Completed build 
And I wanted to document it here - the build; the programming bit; the learning to fly bit..
But then we got into it. And I soon realised 3D printing the chassis/frame was actually going to be the easy bit.
Drones builds are a massive topic - when you&amp;rsquo;re starting out. Involved, time consuming, but hugely rewarding, is the best way I can sum it up.</description>
