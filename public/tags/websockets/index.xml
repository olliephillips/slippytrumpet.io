      <description>Communicating using the Bluetooth protocol has traditionally been the sole preserve of native applications. Now you can do it from a web page! This is the first of two short posts on my experiments with Puck.js and Web Bluetooth. This one looks at security; the second will look at a Web Bluetooth to MQTT gateway experiment.
What&amp;rsquo;s Web Bluetooth? Some may know, that from Google Chrome v56, the Web Bluetooth API went from being an experimental &amp;ldquo;opt-in&amp;rdquo; feature to enabled by default.</description>

      <description>A broken radio controlled microcar; just lying in a box, useless. A little knowledge of Espruino and winter nights closing in. &amp;ldquo;We can make this car work again - but over Wifi&amp;rdquo;, I told the kids. And that was my first mistake. First, one of those, &amp;ldquo;blimey this is a long post; maybe I won&amp;rsquo;t bother&amp;rdquo; things.. AKA &amp;ldquo;TL;DR&amp;rdquo;.
Espruino/JavaScript code which runs on a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller and does this.</description>
